## üìã NEXT STEP: Add Custom Domain (thegavl.com)

I've opened the Vercel dashboard in your browser. Here's what you need to do:

### In Vercel Dashboard (Already Open):

1. You should see the "Domains" settings page
2. In the "Domain" input field, type: **thegavl.com**
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Vercel will show you DNS records to configure

### DNS Records You'll Need to Add in GoDaddy:

Once you add the domain in Vercel, you'll see something like this:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
TTL: 600

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
TTL: 600
```

### In GoDaddy (You'll need to do this):

1. Go to: https://godaddy.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Go to "My Products" ‚Üí "Domains"
4. Click on **thegavl.com**
5. Click **"DNS"** or **"Manage DNS"**
6. Find the existing **A record** for `@` and edit it:
   - Change the value to the IP shown in Vercel (usually `76.76.21.21`)
7. Find the existing **CNAME record** for `www` and edit it:
   - Change the value to `cname.vercel-dns.com`
8. Save changes

### Wait for DNS Propagation (5-30 minutes)

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS!

Your GAVL website is **LIVE** and the AI prediction API is **WORKING**.

**Estimated time to complete:** 5 minutes + 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
