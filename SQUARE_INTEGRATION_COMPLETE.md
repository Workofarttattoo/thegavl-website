## 🎉 What I Built For You

I've integrated Square's payment terminal directly into TheGAVL website so users can purchase verdicts with their credit card **instantly** - no phone calls needed!

---

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. **Embedded Payment Terminal** 💳
- Live credit card form on purchase-verdicts.html
- Users enter their card info directly on your site
- Secure PCI-compliant processing by Square
- Instant payment confirmation

### 2. **Automated Verdict Allocation** 🎯
- Payment succeeds → Verdicts added to account immediately
- No manual processing needed
- Users can analyze cases right away
- All tracked in localStorage (ready for Supabase upgrade)

### 3. **Three Package Options** 📦
- **Single Verdict:** $39 (1 verdict, 30 days)
- **Professional:** $399 (40 verdicts, 90 days)
- **Firm:** $999 (125 verdicts, 180 days)

### 4. **Production-Ready Code** 🚀
- Serverless API at `/api/square-payment`
- Environment-aware (sandbox for testing, production for live)
- Error handling and user feedback
- Success page with "Start Analyzing" button

## 🧪 Testing in Sandbox Mode

The site is currently set up in **sandbox mode** for testing. You can test with these fake cards:

### Test Credit Card:
```
Card Number:   4111 1111 1111 1111
CVV:           111
Zip:           12345
Expiration:    Any future date (e.g., 12/26)
```

### Test the Flow:
1. Go to: **https://thegavl-website.vercel.app/purchase-verdicts.html**
2. Enter your name and email
3. Select "Single Verdict - $39"
4. Click "Continue to Payment"
5. Enter the test card above
6. Click "Complete Payment"
7. ✅ You'll see: "Payment Successful! 1 verdict credits added"
8. Click "Start Analyzing Cases" to test the full flow

**Note:** In sandbox mode, no real money is charged. These are simulated transactions.
